Made a typetest. Its not bad I won't lie made a lot of implementation choices that fix some of the problems I have with other sites. Feel free to check out the site and tell me if anything could be improved:

https://www.typev2.dev/

Made with:
- Next.js (app router)
- Typescript react
- trpc
- planetscale (mysql relational database)


All of the code I use is in this repository so feel free to check it out! 

I still want to add a lot of things to the site like session information (the blank box in the test page), and some other settings (showing a cursor vs highlighting words) so more patches will be coming! This is just the minimum viable product for now.
